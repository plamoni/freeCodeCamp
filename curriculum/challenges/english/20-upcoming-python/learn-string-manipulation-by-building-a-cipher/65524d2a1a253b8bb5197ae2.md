# --description--

As you can see, uppercase letters are still an issue. In fact, `find` returns `-1` for them, and for the space character, too. You are going to take care of the space later on.
For now, instead of looping over `text`, try to iterate over `text.lower()`.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for char in text:
    index = alphabet.find(char)
    print(char, index)
--fcc-editable-region--
```
