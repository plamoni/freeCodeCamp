# --description--

Each string character can be referenced by a numerical index. The index count starts at zero. So the first character of a string has an index of `0`. For example, in the string `"Hello World"`, "H" is at index `0`, "e" is at index `1` and so on.
You can access each character of a string by using the bracket notation. You need to write the variable name followed by two square brackets `[]` enclosing the index.
Now, instead of printing `text`, print just the character at index `6`.
