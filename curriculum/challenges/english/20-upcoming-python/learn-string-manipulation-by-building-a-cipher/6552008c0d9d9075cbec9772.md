# --description--

In this project, you are going to build a cipher. You want to take each letter in your plain message, see the actual position in the alphabet, take the letter located after 3 positions, and replace the original letter with that. This kind of cipher is called *Caesar* cipher, from Julius Caesar.

Let's start by finding the position occupied by the first letter in our string. One way is to use the built-in `find()` function. The syntax is the following:

```py
a_string.find(char)
```

In the example above, `char` is the character you want to locate and `a_string` is the string you want to parse.

At the end of your code, call `find()` on your `alphabet` string and pass in `text[0]`.
