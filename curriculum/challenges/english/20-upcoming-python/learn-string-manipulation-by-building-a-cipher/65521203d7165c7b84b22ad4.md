# --description--

Repeating all this process for each character in `text` would be really annoying. Fortunately, you can use a loop for that. A loop enables you to iterate through a sequence of elements and perform actions on each element.
Now you are going to use a `for` loop. The general syntax is:

```py
for i in iterable:
    <code>
```

`i` sequentially takes the value of the elements in `iterable`. It can have any valid name, but it's convenient to give it a meaningful name. `iterable` is the sequence you want to iterate over. Last but not least, the code to execute at each iteration constitutes the body of the loop and must be indented — typically 4 spaces — from the loop level. This indented level is a code block.

Remove everything after the `alphabet` line. Then create a `for` loop to iterate over `text`. Inside the body print each character of your `text`.

```py

text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
index = alphabet.find(text[0].lower())
print(index)
shifted = alphabet[index + shifted]
print(shifted)
