# --description--

Repeating this process for each character in `text` can be tedious. Thankfully, you can simplify it using a loop. A loop allows you to systematically go through a sequence of elements and execute actions on each one.

In this case, you'll employ a `for` loop. The syntax is as follows:

```py
for i in iterable:
    <code>
```

`i` sequentially takes the value of the elements in `iterable`. It can have any valid name, but it's convenient to give it a meaningful name. `iterable` is the sequence you want to iterate over. Last but not least, the code to execute at each iteration constitutes the body of the loop and must be indented — typically 4 spaces — from the loop level. This indented level is a code block.

Remove everything after the `alphabet` line. Then create a `for` loop to iterate over `text`. Inside the body print each character of your `text`.
