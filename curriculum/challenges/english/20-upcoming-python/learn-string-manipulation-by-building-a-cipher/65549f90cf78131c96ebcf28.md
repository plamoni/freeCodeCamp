# --description--

When you write code, it's important to keep things readable. Comments enables you to write notes about your code and they are very effective to explain the logic behind it. Comments are very helpful both for you, when you come back to work on a project after days or weeks, and for your collegues.

In Python you can write a comment using a `#`. Anything that comes after the `#` won't be executed.
Add a comment saying `Append space to the message`.

text = 'Hello Zaira'
custom_key = 'python'

def vigenere(message, key):
    key_index = 0
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted_text = ''

    for char in message.lower():
--fcc-editable-region--
        
        if char == ' ':
            encrypted_text += char
--fcc-editable-region--            
        else:
            index = alphabet.find(char)    
            new_index = (index + offset) % len(alphabet)
            encrypted_text += alphabet[new_index]
    print('plain text:', text)
    print('encrypted text:', encrypted_text)

```
