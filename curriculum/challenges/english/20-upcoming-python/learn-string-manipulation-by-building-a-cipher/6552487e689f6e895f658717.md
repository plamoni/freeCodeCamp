# --description--

The line you've just added won't work. And the reason is because strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once created.
This does not mean you cannot re-assign a variable to another string. For example, you could write something like:

```py
message = 'Hello World'
message = 'Hello there!'
```

But the code above does not change the string `Hello World`. Instead it makes the `text` variable point to a completely new string.

That said, you need another approach: modify the last line in the loop body changing the variable name into `new_char`.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for char in text.lower():
    index = alphabet.find(char)
    print(char, index)
    new_index = index + shift
    char = alphabet[new_index]
--fcc-editable-region--
```
