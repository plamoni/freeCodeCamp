# --description--

There are a few remaining challenges. For instance, spaces consistently get encrypted as `c`. To maintain the original spacing in the plain message, you'll require a conditional `if` statement. This is composed of the `if` keyword, a condition, and a colon `:`.

```py
if condition:
    <code>
```

Remember, the code to be executed when the condition is met should be indented one level beneath the `if` statement.

Notes on indentation in Python:

- Indentation is used to indicate blocks of code.
- Statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block.
- Nested blocks are created by increasing the level of indentation.
- A colon (:) at the end of a line is a signal that a new indented block of code will follow.

At the top of your for loop, replace `print(char == ' ')` with an `if` statement that triggers when `char` is an empty space. Inside the loop body, print the string `space!`. Remember to indent this line.

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for char in text.lower():
    print(char == ' ')
    index = alphabet.find(char)    
    new_index = index + shift
    encrypted_text += alphabet[new_index]
    print('char:', char, 'encrypted text:', encrypted_text)
