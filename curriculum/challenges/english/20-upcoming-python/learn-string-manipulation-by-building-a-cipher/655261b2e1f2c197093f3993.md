# --description--

There are still a couple of things to solve. For example, spaces are always encrypted as `c`. You want to keep the spacing as in the plain message. For that you will need a conditional `if` statement, constituted by the `if` keyword, followed by a condition and a colon, `:`. Again, the code to execute if the condition is met must be indented of one level respect to `if` level.

```py
if condition:
    <code>
```

The condition you want to check is `char == ' '`, where `==` is the equality operator, meaning that you are verifying if `char` is en empty space.
At the top of your `for` loop, add an `if` statement that triggers when `char == ' '`. Inside the loop body print the string `space!`. Remember to indent this line.

```py

text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
encrypted_text = ''

for char in text.lower():
    index = alphabet.find(char)    
    new_index = index + shift
    encrypted_text += alphabet[new_index]
    print('char:', char, 'encrypted text:', encrypted_text)
