# --description--

In Python, you can use variables of different types. You've just used an integer value, but if you want to represent some text you need to use a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes like this:

```py
string_1 = "I am a string"
string_2 = 'I am also a string'
```

You can use either single or double quotes to surround the text, the important thing is that you cannot use both together. For example, this is not a valid code:

```py
string_3 = 'This is not valid"
```

Now delete your `number` variable and its value. Then, create another variable called `text` and assign it the string `Hello World`.
