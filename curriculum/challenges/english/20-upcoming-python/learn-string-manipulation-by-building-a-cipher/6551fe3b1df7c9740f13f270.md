# --description--

Before we go on, here are some key aspects of variable naming in Python you should keep in mind:

- Some words like `for`, `while`, `True` and others are reserved keywords. They have a special meaning in Python and you cannot use them for naming your variables.
- Variable names cannot start with a number and can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.
- Variable names are case sentitive. Thats is `my_var` is different from `my_Var` or `MY_VAR`.
- Finally, in Python it is a common convention to write variable names using `snake_case`, with each space replaced by an underscore character and the words written in lowercase letters.

Now remove both your `print` calls, then create another variable called `alphabet` and assign it the string value of `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.
